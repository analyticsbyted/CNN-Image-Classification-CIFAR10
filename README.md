# CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This repository contains code and resources for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal of the project is to accurately classify images into ten different classes, including objects like airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, and more.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. This was sourced at [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used for image classification consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers with a softmax activation function for multi-class classification. The model architecture is as follows:

model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3), name='conv_1'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='maxpool_1'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv_2'))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv_3'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='maxpool_2'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', name='dense_1'))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output'))


## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Preprocess the dataset by resizing the images and normalizing pixel values.
3. Train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance using the validation set.
4. Test the trained model on the test set and measure its accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
5. Experiment with different techniques such as fine-tuning the model architecture, optimization methods, or transfer learning for further improvement.

## Results and Analysis

The trained model achieved an accuracy of approximately 68% on the test set. Evaluation metrics including loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix provide insights into the model's performance and areas for improvement.

## Future Work

To enhance the model's performance, several suggestions for future work include fine-tuning the model architecture, exploring different optimization techniques or regularization methods, and investigating transfer learning approaches. The trained model can have potential applications in real-world scenarios such as object recognition, content filtering, or any tasks that require accurate image classification.
